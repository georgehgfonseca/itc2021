## Getting Started

This repository contains an integer programming formulation and a fix-and-optimize method to address the Sports Timetabling Problem proposed during the International Timetabling Competition of 2021 (ITC2021)

### Compiling the code

This project now uses [gradle](http://gradle.org "Gradle").
It simplifies compiling the code with its dependencies. Just run:

- gradle build

The jar file (``itc2021.jar``) will be generated.

### Usage examples:

- ``java -jar upmsp.jar instance.txt solution.txt``  
- ``java -jar upmsp.jar instance.txt solution.txt -algorithm sa -alpha 0.98 -saMax 1000 -t0 100000``  
- ``java -jar upmsp.jar instance.txt solution.txt -algorithm ils -rnaMax 10000000 -itersP 700 -p0 10 -pMax 5``  
- ``java -jar upmsp.jar instance.txt solution.txt -algorithm lahc -listSize 100``  
- ``java -jar upmsp.jar instance.txt solution.txt -algorithm schc -stepSize 100``  

### Requirements

Java 16, Gurobi 9 and [Apache Commons Math](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/ "Apache Commons Math") library are required.
